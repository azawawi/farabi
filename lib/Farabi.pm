=head1 HISTORY

The idea started back in March 2012 as a fork of L<Padre>. I wanted to dump L<Wx> for the browser. 
The first version was in 11th April as L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Pedro>. It used the ACE Javascript
editor and jQuery UI. Then i hibernated for a while to play games :) Later I heard about L<Galileo>.
It basically used the same idea, mojolicious backend, browser for the frontend. So I stopped 
playing games and rolled my sleeves to focus on Pedro.

Later I discovered Pedro was not a good name for my project. So I chose Farabi for
L<Al-Farabi|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Farabi> who was a renowned scientist and philosopher
of the Islamic Golden Age. He was also a cosmologist, logician,and musician.
